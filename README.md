# Portfolio
This is an online portfolio of course material gathered for the Heinz College course - Telling Stories with Data, Spring 2020

# About Me
My name is Caleb Banks. I prefer he, his, him pronouns. At Heinz College, I am in the MSPPM 2-year program. I'm a young ambitious man from San Francisco, California obsessed with human psychology and curious about public policy tools to manage systems in supporting human psychological well-being. Upon graduating from Heinz, I plan to combine tools of analytics and apply them to improve and study human behavior, but at this point in time I can't be more specific about where I will be working, the specific projects I'd like to contribute to, or where I will be living (NYC or SF). Will figure that out in the coming weeks and months. 

# What I hope to learn
I would like to learn how to take messy, complex data and visualize it to novice audiences in powerful, coherent, and meaningful ways.
